This is a mini game that I started in my sophomore year. The website is is actually an in-progress game but has the name "Learning Center" to avoid game site detection.

This is two player and the players are the squares. The yellow dots are "Coins", you try collecting as many of them in one minute.
Red square is Player One, you move with WASD keys. Blue square is Player Two, you use the ARROW keys.
The sliders at the bottom are for manually changing player speed.

Enjoy?

(There might be online multiplayer soon)
